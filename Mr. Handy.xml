			<h4>MR. HANDY TRAITS</h4>
			<p>In the year 2037, General Atomics International released the first domestic robot for the general masses. These multipurpose robots have been commonly used in homes, hospitals, and even the military.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span>Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 1.<br />
				<span class="feature">Age.</span>A Mr. Handy has a 500 year warranty.<br />
				<span class="feature">Alignment.</span>Mr. Handys are programmed to follow commands and help for the greater good, but after such a long time in the wild, their programming can change.<br />
				<span class="feature">Size.</span>A Mr. Handyâ€™s metal body is made of a 3-foot diameter sphere with 3 arms that float 3 feet off the ground. They weigh 120 pounds.<br />
				<span class="feature">Speed.</span>Your base walking speed is 25 feet.<br />
				<span class="feature">Languages.</span>You can speak, read, and write in Common and one other language.<br />
        <span class="feature">Arms!</span>Your 3 arms are versatile tools for completing everyday tasks, but they can also become much more. During a short rest, you can replace one of your hands with any weapon that does not have the Heavy property. This new attached weapon gains +1 to attack rolls.<br />
        <span class="feature">You Are a Robot.</span>As a robot, you are immune to disease. You do not need to eat or breathe. Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.<br />
        <span class="feature">Fix Me Up.</span>You do not heal like other races. As an action, you or another character within 5 ft. can make a Technology (Arcana) check. The DC is equal to your level. On a success, you heal 2d4+4 hit points.<br />
